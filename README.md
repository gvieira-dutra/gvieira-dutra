Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Gleison, a passionate learner on the journey to becoming a Senior Software Engineer specializing in C# within the .NET framework. My skill set spans C#, C++, SQL, JavaScript, and some Python, complemented by experience in Sales, People Management, and Construction.

Logic fuels my passion for development. I love watching systems interact and come to life as complete applications. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me staying active outdoorsâ€”whether it's running, hiking, or walking my dog.

Iâ€™m open to collaborations and connections, so feel free to reach out!
