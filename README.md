Hey there! 👋 Gleison here, an eager learner currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis. 🧑‍🎓 

I have a diverse skill set, including programming in C#, C++, SQL, JavaScript, and Python. Additionally, I have experience in Sales, People Management, and Construction. I'm also building knowledge in machine learning, system analysis, and exploring Next.js to boost my web development abilities. 💻

In my free time, I enjoy staying active outdoors whether it's running, hiking, or taking my dog for a walk. I'm a lifelong learner, always seeking new skills and experiences, from gardening to playing guitar 🎸 and martial arts. 

Feel free to connect for any colabs.
